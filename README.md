# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

## 📌 Objective
This project explores how different **prompting patterns** influence the outputs of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of each pattern across multiple real-world test scenarios.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios & Pattern Analysis

### 1. 📝 Instructional Pattern
- **Definition:** Gives step-by-step instructions on how to do something.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  `"Explain how to implement a binary search algorithm in Python."`
- **Use Case:** Tutorials, guides, learning steps.
- **Strengths:** Clear procedural output.  
- **Limitations:** Needs clarity; vague prompts give shallow answers.

---

### 2. ⚖️ Comparison Pattern
- **Definition:** Compares two or more subjects based on key aspects.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  `"Compare renewable energy and fossil fuels in terms of environmental impact."`
- **Use Case:** Evaluation, decision-making, product comparisons.
- **Strengths:** Structured output (e.g., pros/cons).  
- **Limitations:** May oversimplify or reflect bias if poorly framed.

---

### 3. 💬 Command Pattern
- **Definition:** Gives a direct instruction to perform a task.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  `"Generate 5 bullet points summarizing the benefits of exercise."`
- **Use Case:** Content creation, summaries, formatting.
- **Strengths:** Straightforward output.  
- **Limitations:** May need refinement to increase depth/quality.

---

### 4. ❓ Q&A Pattern
- **Definition:** Asks a question and expects a direct answer.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  `"What are the symptoms of iron deficiency?"`
- **Use Case:** Fact-based querying, FAQs.
- **Strengths:** Fast, accurate for general knowledge.  
- **Limitations:** May lack context or depth; can be outdated.

---

### 5. 🗣️ Opinion / Argument Pattern
- **Definition:** Seeks opinions or reasoned arguments.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  `"Should social media be regulated by governments? Give your opinion."`
- **Use Case:** Essays, debates, discussions.
- **Strengths:** Promotes reasoning and multi-perspective views.  
- **Limitations:** May lean toward one-sided answers or biased outputs.

---

### 6. 🎭 Scenario Pattern
- **Definition:** Describes a situation and asks for action or prediction.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  `"You are a project manager and your team missed a deadline. What steps would you take?"`
- **Use Case:** Case studies, simulations, role-playing.
- **Strengths:** Encourages creativity and problem-solving.  
- **Limitations:** Requires clear context to avoid confusion.

## 🧪 Suggested Experiments

You can try using all six patterns on a **single topic**, like:

> `"Climate change"`  
> and observe how the outputs differ:

| Pattern     | Prompt Example |
|-------------|----------------|
| Instructional | "Explain how to reduce carbon emissions at home." |
| Comparison | "Compare the impact of air pollution and water pollution." |
| Command | "List 5 effects of climate change in bullet points." |
| Q&A | "What causes global warming?" |
| Opinion | "Do you think climate change is reversible?" |
| Scenario | "Imagine you're a policymaker addressing rising sea levels. What would you propose?" |
